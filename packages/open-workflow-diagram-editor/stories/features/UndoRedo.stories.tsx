## Undo / Redo

The \`DiagramEditor\` component exposes an imperative \`ref\` API that lets host
applications call \`undo()\`, \`redo()\`, \`getContent()\`, and \`setContent()\`
programmatically, and read \`canUndo\` / \`canRedo\` to drive toolbar or menu state.

### How it works

History recording is **disabled in read-only mode** and starts automatically
the first time a valid workflow model is loaded in **edit mode**
(\`isReadOnly={false}\`).

A new history entry is created whenever the workflow model changes
structurally — for example when the external \`content\` prop is updated by
an addon panel, a text editor, or a \`setContent()\` call. Transient state
such as viewport pan/zoom does **not** create a new entry on its own.

Each snapshot captures three pieces of state atomically:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| \`model\` | \`Specification.Workflow\` | The full parsed workflow definition |
| \`viewport\` | \`{ x, y, zoom }\` | Pan, scroll, and zoom position |
| \`selectedNodeId\` | \`string \\| null\` | Currently selected node or edge ID |

All three are restored together when \`undo()\` or \`redo()\` is called, so the
diagram, viewport, and side-panel selection are always consistent.

#### Selection persistence across content reloads

When the external \`content\` prop changes (e.g. an addon panel edits the YAML),
the selected node or edge is **preserved** if its ID still exists in the new
model. It is only cleared when the node or edge has been removed by the change.

#### Stack behaviour

The history stack is capped at **10 entries** (\`HISTORY_STACK_SIZE\`).
When that limit is reached the oldest entry is evicted. When a new change
occurs while there are future entries (i.e. the user has previously undone
some steps), all future entries are discarded before the new snapshot is
pushed — producing a strictly linear history with no branches.

### Ref API

\`\`\`tsx
import { useRef } from "react";
import { DiagramEditor, DiagramEditorRef } from "@openworkflowspec/open-workflow-diagram-editor";

const editorRef = useRef<DiagramEditorRef>(null);

<DiagramEditor ref={editorRef} content={yaml} isReadOnly={false} locale="en" />
\`\`\`

| Member | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| \`undo()\` | \`() => void\` | Step back one history entry. No-op if nothing to undo. |
| \`redo()\` | \`() => void\` | Step forward one history entry. No-op if nothing to redo. |
| \`canUndo\` | \`boolean\` | \`true\` when there is at least one past entry to undo. |
| \`canRedo\` | \`boolean\` | \`true\` when there is at least one future entry to redo. |
| \`getContent()\` | \`() => string\` | Returns the current workflow serialised to a string. Returns \`""\` when no model is loaded. |
| \`setContent(content)\` | \`(content: string) => void\` | Loads a new workflow from a YAML or JSON string. The format is auto-detected and preserved for future \`getContent()\` calls. Silently ignored if the string cannot be parsed. |

---

### \`getContent()\`

Serialises the current model back to the **same format the editor received
on first load**: if the initial \`content\` prop was JSON it returns JSON; if
it was YAML it returns YAML. The format is fixed at mount time and preserved
for the lifetime of the component, so undo/redo always round-trips in the
original format. Returns \`""\` when no valid model has been loaded yet.

\`\`\`tsx
// Retrieve current content (format matches the original input — YAML or JSON):
const content = editorRef.current?.getContent();
\`\`\`

---

### \`setContent(content)\`

Loads a new workflow definition from a YAML or JSON string, exactly as if
the \`content\` prop had been updated externally. The serialisation format is
**auto-detected** from the supplied string and becomes the new format used by
subsequent \`getContent()\` calls. Silently ignored when the string cannot be
parsed as a valid workflow.

In edit mode, a successful \`setContent()\` call pushes a new entry onto the
history stack, so the change is immediately undoable.

\`\`\`tsx
// Replace the diagram with a new YAML definition:
editorRef.current?.setContent(\`
document: "1.0.0"
name: my-workflow
do:
  - step1:
      call: http
      with:
        method: GET
        endpoint: https://example.com
\`);

// Or load from JSON:
editorRef.current?.setContent(JSON.stringify({
  document: "1.0.0",
  name: "my-workflow",
  do: [{ step1: { call: "http", with: { method: "GET", endpoint: "https://example.com" } } }],
}, null, 2));
\`\`\`

After calling \`setContent()\`, sync \`canUndo\` / \`canRedo\` into local state
(see the deferred-sync pattern below) so toolbar buttons reflect the updated
history stack.

---

### Syncing \`canUndo\` / \`canRedo\` into React state

\`canUndo\` and \`canRedo\` are **plain values on the ref object**, not reactive
state. To drive toolbar buttons, copy them into local state after each
operation and after external content changes:

\`\`\`tsx
const [canUndo, setCanUndo] = useState(false);
const [canRedo, setCanRedo] = useState(false);

const sync = useCallback(() => {
  setCanUndo(editorRef.current?.canUndo ?? false);
  setCanRedo(editorRef.current?.canRedo ?? false);
}, []);

// Sync after external content changes (e.g. addon panel updates the YAML):
useEffect(() => {
  const id = setTimeout(sync, 0); // defer one tick so the ref has settled
  return () => clearTimeout(id);
}, [content, sync]);

// Sync after a button-triggered undo/redo:
const handleUndo = () => {
  editorRef.current?.undo();
  setTimeout(sync, 0);
};

// Sync after a setContent call:
const handleSetContent = (newContent: string) => {
  editorRef.current?.setContent(newContent);
  setTimeout(sync, 0);
};
\`\`\`

> The \`setTimeout(..., 0)\` deferral is necessary because \`useImperativeHandle\`
> updates the ref values one render after the internal state changes.

### Calling the API from the browser console

This story publishes the editor ref on \`window.diagramEditor\` so you can
exercise the full API directly from the browser DevTools console **without
writing any code**:

1. Open the Storybook story **Features → Undo Redo → UndoRedo** in a browser.
2. Open the browser DevTools (**F12** or **⌘ ⌥ I**) and navigate to the **Console** tab.
3. Make sure the correct frame is selected — if Storybook runs the story in an
   \`<iframe>\`, switch the console context to that frame using the frame picker
   in the DevTools toolbar.
4. Run any of the following commands:

\`\`\`js
// Step back / forward through history:
diagramEditor.undo();
diagramEditor.redo();

// Check whether undo/redo is available:
diagramEditor.canUndo; // boolean
diagramEditor.canRedo; // boolean

// Read the current workflow (YAML or JSON, matching the original input):
diagramEditor.getContent();

// Replace the diagram content programmatically (YAML or JSON):
diagramEditor.setContent(\`
document: "1.0.0"
name: console-test
do:
  - greet:
      call: http
      with:
        method: GET
        endpoint: https://example.com
\`);
\`\`\`

> **Tip:** The toolbar buttons above the diagram (**Undo**, **Redo**,
> **Set Content**, **Get Content**) call the same ref methods, so you can
> freely mix toolbar interactions with console calls.
